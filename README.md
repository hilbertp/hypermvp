# **HyperMVP**
HyperMVP is a Python-based project designed to process, analyze, and clean data related to the German energy control market, particularly focusing on aFRR (automatic frequency restoration reserve) and provider data.

## **Features**
- Structured data storage in directories for raw, processed, and output data (`data/`).
- Python-based automation for data processing and analysis within the `src/` folder.
- Main entry point to execute the project (`main.py`).
- Integrated data processing tests, likely within the `src/` folder (e.g., `test_loader.py`).
