- **Files Added**: 8+

  - .gitkeep: Created new directory structure
  - snapshots: Added directory for database snapshots
  - utils: Created utility module with versioning functionality
  - db_versioning.py: Implemented snapshot and metadata functions

### Features Added

- DuckDB integration for persistent structured data storage
- Database versioning with snapshot functionality for recovery
- Explicit schema handling to prevent type inference issues with mixed data
- Period-based incremental data update mechanism
- New directory structure for database storage
- Type safety checks to ensure consistent data types

### Features Changed

- Replaced CSV export with direct DuckDB database updates
- Fixed schema mismatch issues when handling text vs. numeric fields
- Restructured workflow to avoid duplicate file loading
- Enhanced error handling throughout the pipeline
- Improved logging for debugging and traceability

### Technical Details

- Fixed critical issue where "aFRR" string was being inserted into INT32 column
- Implemented explicit CREATE TABLE with proper types instead of relying on inference
- Created adapter pattern for different data sources to use consistent database approach
- Added column type forcing before database operations to ensure consistency

### Next Steps

- Evaluate snapshot retention policy to prevent database size bloat
- Add compression for snapshots
- Consider implementing VACUUM command for space reclamation
