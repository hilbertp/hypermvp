# Marginal Price Analysis for Balancing Energy Markets

This document provides a functional overview of the algorithm for calculating the **marginal price**—the highest price activated for balancing energy in a specific 15-minute interval—in the German automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve (aFRR) market. It focuses solely on the **business logic**, outlining the processes and decisions involved. The approach optimizes profitability and pricing strategy by reflecting the market practice that provider pools are specific to each 15-minute interval rather than fixed across 4-hour blocks.

## Key Insight: Provider Pool Granularity
While providers are legally required to offer services across an entire 4-hour block, market data reveals fluctuations in tenders within these periods. Consequently, the provider pool is not fixed across the 4-hour block but is instead specific to each **15-minute interval**. Providers submit separate bids for each 15-minute period, enabling a precise match between the aFRR need and the available offers. This granularity simplifies mapping aFRR demand to available offers and enhances the accuracy of marginal price calculations.

## Terminology for Time Periods
The balancing energy market relies on specific time period definitions:

- **15-Minuten-Perioden** (German) / **15-minute intervals** or **quarter-hour intervals** (English):  
  These are the time units for reporting and settling aFRR volumes, as well as the basis for provider bids and activations.

- **4-Stunden-Perioden** (German) / **4-hour blocks**, **4-hour time slices**, or **4-hour product periods** (English):  
  These are the broader periods for tendering and procurement, though provider offers are submitted and managed for each 15-minute interval within them.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation
The analysis requires two key datasets:

1. **aFRR Activation Data**:  
   - Details the activated aFRR volumes (positive or negative) for each 15-minute interval.
   - This data is sourced from files, cleaned for accuracy, and stored for analysis.

2. **Provider Offer Data**:  
   - Includes bids from providers for each 15-minute interval, specifying capacities (in MW) and energy prices (in EUR/MWh).
   - This data is similarly loaded, cleaned, and prepared.

The preparation process involves:  
- Loading data from files.  
- Cleaning it for consistency and accuracy (e.g., validating entries, standardizing formats).  
- Saving the cleaned data for use in the analysis.  

Since provider offers align with the 15-minute intervals of the activation data, no complex mapping across broader periods is needed.

## Merit Order Principle
The **merit order principle** determines how the Transmission System Operator (TSO) selects provider offers:  

- For **negative aFRR**, offers are sorted by energy price in **ascending order**:  
  - From the most negative prices (where providers pay the TSO the most) to less negative, then to positive prices from lowest to highest.  
- The TSO activates offers starting with the lowest price, continuing until the required aFRR volume is met.  

This ensures the TSO minimizes costs by prioritizing the most cost-effective offers.

## Determining the Marginal Price
The marginal price is the energy price of the last offer activated to fulfill the aFRR demand in a given 15-minute interval. The steps are:  

1. **Identify the 15-minute interval** using its product code (e.g., `NEG_065` for 16:00–16:15).  
2. **Retrieve provider offers** for that interval from the prepared data.  
3. **Sort the offers** by energy price in ascending order (for negative aFRR).  
4. **Determine the activated aFRR volume** for the interval from the activation data.  
5. **Calculate the marginal price**:  
   - Start with an accumulated capacity of zero.  
   - Add each offer’s capacity in sequence, tracking the total.  
   - Stop when the accumulated capacity meets or exceeds the activated volume.  
   - The energy price of the last offer included is the marginal price.  

If the activated volume exceeds the total available capacity, the marginal price is the energy price of the final offer in the sorted list.

## Example: Marginal Price Calculation
Consider a 15-minute interval (`NEG_065`, 16:00–16:15 on April 17, 2024) with an activated volume of **80.528 MW**. The provider offers are:  

- Provider A: 30 MW at -5.00 EUR/MWh  
- Provider B: 30 MW at -4.00 EUR/MWh  
- Provider C: 30 MW at -3.87 EUR/MWh  
- Provider D: 40 MW at 10.00 EUR/MWh  

### Process:  
1. **Sort offers by energy price (ascending)**:  
   - Provider A: -5.00 EUR/MWh  
   - Provider B: -4.00 EUR/MWh  
   - Provider C: -3.87 EUR/MWh  
   - Provider D: 10.00 EUR/MWh  

2. **Accumulate capacities until exceeding 80.528 MW**:  
   - Provider A: 30 MW (total = 30 MW)  
   - Provider B: 30 MW (total = 60 MW)  
   - Provider C: 30 MW (total = 90 MW, exceeds 80.528 MW)  

3. **Determine the marginal price**:  
   - The last offer included is Provider C at **-3.87 EUR/MWh**.  

Thus, the marginal price is **-3.87 EUR/MWh**.

## Conclusion
This method accurately calculates the marginal price in the German aFRR market by aligning provider offers with each **15-minute interval**. By matching aFRR needs directly to the corresponding provider pool, it enhances pricing precision, supporting improved profitability and strategic decisions in the balancing energy market.
